# CubeSat Magnetic-Torque Attitude Control Simulator

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

Simulate and visualize a CubeSatâ€™s attitude dynamics using Earthâ€™s magnetic field and on-board magnetic torquers.  
This SCILAB-based framework computes quaternion evolution, angular rates, pointing error, magnetic dipole moments, and applied control torques.
